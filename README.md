# Analysis & Visualization of Ride-sharing Data
## 1 Overview of Project

The purpose of the project was to create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type for PyBer, a ride-sharing app company. This was accompished using Pandas to create tabular views and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graphical view of the total weekly fares for each city type. The project columnated in creating this report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## 2 Approach and Analysis

### 2.1 Input Data Provided

We were provided with two csv files from from which to conduct our analysis.  The first file consists of data about the city, drivers and types of cities.  You can see from the code below that the types consist of Urban, Suburban and Rural.

In figure 2, below you can see the ride data than consists of 2375 records of individual ride that have been provide through Pyber.

You will notice that the two data sets have a common data item "city".  Using this common piece of information we were able to create a merged DataFrame that would allow us to conduct further analysis.  The merge data is presented in Table 1 below.

### 2.2 Analysis of Data

In this section we looked at the merged data to extract the columns below.  You will notice in the code that I actually first generated many of the numbers individually, which served as confirmation that the structure of code that grabbed the complete columns was correct.  The code in figure 3 below was used to extract a column of data representing the total fares for each type of city.
