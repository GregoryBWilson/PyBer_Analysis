# Analysis & Visualization of Ride-sharing Data
## 1 Overview of Project

The purpose of the project was to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type for PyBer, a ride-sharing app company. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The project columnated in creating this report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
